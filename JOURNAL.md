# August 8 - Researching costs, specs, etc. 
after thinking of making this for over a month now, i got started. i reached out to @ayaangrover who created loop, and after getting some useful advice i did my research. i found out the Hardware Grant is my best option, and that i'll probably have
to use the XIAO ESP32 since my budget wont allow for more.

i figured out how my mp3 player would work, the things i need, the costs, and the specific components i should use (considering my budget and my skill level - im not great at hardware so i wont use anything that involves complex power management
and stuff like that)

i still got a long way to go!
