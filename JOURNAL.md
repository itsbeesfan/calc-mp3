# August 8 - Researching costs, specs, etc. 
after thinking of making this for over a month now, i got started. i reached out to @ayaangrover who created loop, and after getting some useful advice i did my research. i found out the Hardware Grant is my best option, and that i'll probably have
to use the XIAO ESP32 since my budget wont allow for more.

i figured out how my mp3 player would work, the things i need, the costs, and the specific components i should use (considering my budget and my skill level - im not great at hardware so i wont use anything that involves complex power management
and stuff like that)

i still got a long way to go!

# August 12 - start KiCad proyect, look for footprints, keep calculating costs.
i'll admit, this is taking a while. it took some time to find the footprints, and i still haven't found the button footprints. it's late though, so i'll figure it out tomorrow. however, im now in budget and already have (almost) all of the footprints in KiCad. hopefully i'll get wiring soon!
